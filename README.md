# Superliquid: HotStuff-Based BFT Consensus with native spot orderbook DEX (Work-in-Progress)

A Rust implementation of a **Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT)** consensus protocol inspired by [HotStuff](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05069), extended with a native spot decentralised exchange (DEX) integrated directly into the execution layer. This project aims to demonstrate rotating leader consensus, peer-to-peer networking, chained hotstuff pipelining and native DEX orderbook matching. 

> **Status**: Basic Layer one blockchain and Spot DEX functionality are completed. Perps DEX in development. Any and all feedback is welcome!

## Overview

This repository implements the core components of a HotStuff-style consensus mechanism, designed for high throughput and fault tolerance:

* **Pacemaker**: Manages view changes, including timeouts, new-view messages, and leader rotation.
* **Peer-to-Peer Network Layer**: Built with `tokio` for efficient asynchronous communication.
* **Replica Logic**: Implements the chained HotStuff pipelining for performance.
* **Leader Rotation**: Employs a round-robin strategy (`leader_id = view % num_replicas`).
* **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Designed to tolerate up to `**f` Byzantine nodes in a network of `3f + 1` replicas, ensuring safety and liveness.
* **Integrated Spot DEX**: Features on-chain order book matching and settlement as part of the block execution, using **price-time** priority directly from the state.

The purpose of this project is to learn, experiment, and demonstrate a BFT consensus mechanism in Rust along with in-protocol financial primitives. The consensus engine and spot DEX are largely complete. Work is ongoing to extend support to a perpetuals DEX with margin, funding rates, and liquidations. This project is not production-ready.

## Key Features

- **Async Rust Networking**: Uses `tokio` to handle concurrent socket connections between replicas and clients.
- **Chained HotStuff**: Enables pipelined consensus with lower latency.
- **Native Spot DEX**: Matching engine executed within the consensus logic based on on-chain order book
- **Deterministic Leader Election**: A rotating leader ensures fairness and mitigates the risk of a single faulty leader stalling the protocol.
- **Exponential Timeouts**: If the protocol doesn’t make progress in a view, replicas increase their timeout before moving to the next view.
- **View Synchronization**: Fast-forward logic ensures that once any replica observes a higher-view message, it jumps to that view to maintain synchronization.
- **Eventual Safety and Liveness**: Adheres to the HotStuff design, ensuring that honest replicas eventually agree on a final sequence of blocks.
- **Priority-Based Mempool**: Mempool prioritizes critical transactions like liquidations and cancels.

## Architecture

The replica node architecture is modular, separating concerns for clarity and maintainability:

* **Consensus Layer**: Handles the core HotStuff protocol, including block proposals, voting, QC formation, commitment, and state management related to consensus.
* **Execution Layer**: Responsible for applying transactions, managing the application state (including the spot clearinghouse), and enforcing state transition rules.
* **Networking and Communication Layer**: Manages all peer-to-peer TCP connections for consensus messages and client interactions, with built-in reconnection logic.


System Data Flow:

Client Transactions
    ↓
PriorityMempool (transaction staging and prioritization)
    ↓
Replica Logic (leader election, block proposal, voting)
    ↓
MessageWindow (view-based message caching)
    ↓
LedgerState (validated transaction application)
    ↓
Committed Blocks (state finalisation)
```

## Key components
### Replica
- Orchestrates block proposal and voting based on the current leader and view number.
- Interfaces with pacemaker, mempool, and ledger state.

### Pacemaker
- Drives view advancement based on timeouts.
- Triggers leader rotation and synchronizes view progression across replicas.

### PriorityMempool
- Manages incoming transactions, ordering them by account nonce.
- Prioritizes urgent operations (i.e. liquidations, cancels) over normal transfers.

### LedgerState
- Validates and applies transactions from committed blocks.
- Maintains the canonical state, including account balances and DEX order books.

### Spot Clearinghouse
- Maintains the in-protocol order books for each market.
- Maintains a live in-protocol orderbook per market.
- Applies limit and market orders based on price-time priority.
- Order execution occurs on commit, ensuring consistency across all honest replicas.

---

## Design Decisions

### Consensus Model
- Implements chained HotStuff for pipelined block progress with reduced view latency.
- Enforces safety (no conflicting commits) and liveness (eventual commit under partial synchrony) by following core HotStuff invariants.
- The consensus layer validates block structure and transaction admissibility, but does not execute transactions or validate state transitions. This design follows the HotStuff separation of consensus and execution, where the leader proposes a block containing valid transactions, and all replicas deterministically apply the same state transition logic upon commit.

### Pacemaker
- Uses exponential backoff timers to handle partial synchrony and avoid view lockstep issues.
- Fast-forwarding enables replicas to synchronize with minimal downtime.

### PriorityMempool
- Organizes pending transactions by per-account nonce, enforcing strict sequential execution, while allowing for replacement of inflight pending transaction if needed.
- Prioritizes urgent actions (e.g., liquidations, cancels) over normal transfers.
- Designed for future scalability: insertion is O(log n) per account, and per-account queue sizes are expected to remain small. 

Future improvements:
- Enforce a hard cap on pending transactions per account to mitigate spam attacks.
- Support bundling multiple sequential transactions per account into a single block to improve liquidation throughput.


### Spot Clearinghouse
- Maintains a protocol-level orderbook per market
- Applies limit and market orders based on price-time priority.
- Order execution occurs on commit, ensuring consistency across all honest replicas.

### Networking and State Management
- Built on `tokio` async primitives to support concurrent peer connections and message passing.
- Ledger state is updated only on committed blocks, ensuring consistency across replicas.
- Transactions are validated against the ledger state during block execution to ensure determinism.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** (1.65+ recommended)  
  Install Rust from [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) or your preferred package manager.  
- **Cargo** (bundled with Rust)  
  Ensure you can run `cargo --version`.

### Setup Keys with `.env`

To provide each node with its identity:
1. Rename the provided `.env-example` file to `.env`
2. This file contains **randomly generated private keys** for each node




### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shawnlimjunhe/superliquid.git  
cd superliquid  
```

2. **Build the Project**  
```bash
cargo build
```

3. **Run Tests** (If desired) 
```bash
cargo test
```

---

## Usage

### Running a Node

Each node is run via a positional `node <id>` argument in individual terminals:
As of now, the protocol requires 4 nodes to run and can tolerate up to 1 node failing.

```bash
cargo run -- node 0   // run node 0  
cargo run -- node 1   // run node 1  
cargo run -- node 2   // run node 2  
cargo run -- node 3   // run node 3  
```
The network may take a short time to stabilize after startup

### Running the Client Console
You can run a **client console** to interact with the network by starting a console instance:

```bash
cargo run -- console 0 // Connects to node 0
```

The client console provides commands to:

- Create/load accounts (Ed25519 keypairs)
- Request a drip (faucet funding) 
- Query your account balance
- View markets
- Place a limit / market order
- Cancel order
- Query open orders
  
After starting the console, type `help` to see available commands.

#### Example flow
Below is a walkthrough of placing and matching a spot trade through the CLI console.  
Note: Transactions may take a moment to finalize after submission, as they must be included in a committed block. The `SUPE` and `USD` assets, along with the `SUPE/USD` market (ID: 0), are initialized at genesis.


1. Create a user account with the `create` command.
![Create account](./assets/create.PNG)
2. Drip `USD` or `SUPE` to your account using `drip SUPE` or `drip USD`.
![Drip funds into account](./assets/drip.PNG)
3. Query your account balance using the `query` command.
4. View available markets using `markets`. Select the `SUPE/USD` market (ID: 0).
![View and select markets](./assets/markets.PNG)
5. Submit a limit buy order.
![Before Limit Buy](./assets/limit_buy.PNG)
6. Your order should now appear in the order book.  
   (Use `re` again to refresh the view.)
![After Limit Buy](./assets/limit_buy_post.PNG)
7. Create and fund another account to fill this order.
![Create account 2](./assets/create_account2.PNG)
8. Submit a market sell from the second account to match the existing order.
![Market sell](./assets/market_sell.PNG)
9. Once the trade settles, balances will be updated for both accounts
- Account 1:
![Filled order - Account 1](./assets/limit_fill.PNG)
- Account 2:
![Filled order - Account 2](./assets/market_sell_post.PNG)





### Observing Logs

You can monitor the console output to see:

- **View changes** when the pacemaker times out or receives higher-view messages.
- **Commits** when the network successfully commits a block.
